# FreeScout MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FreeScout helpdesk ticket management. This server provides tools to interact with FreeScout tickets, analyze issues, and manage customer responses.

## Features

- 🎫 **Ticket Management**: Fetch, analyze, and update FreeScout tickets
- 🔍 **Intelligent Analysis**: Automatically analyze tickets to determine issue type, root cause, and solutions
- 💬 **Draft Responses**: Generate customer replies based on ticket analysis
- 📊 **Advanced Search**: First-class filter parameters with relative time support ("7d", "24h")
- 🔒 **Type Safety**: Full Zod schema validation with structured outputs
- 🔁 **Reliability**: Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- ⚡ **Modern SDK**: Built on MCP SDK 1.25+ with `McpServer` and `registerTool()` patterns

## What's New in v2.0

**Breaking Changes:**

- Search API redesigned with explicit filter parameters instead of query-string syntax
- Migrated to modern `McpServer` class with structured outputs
- Removed Git/GitHub tools (use dedicated Git MCP servers for workflow automation)

**New Features:**

- Explicit search filters: `assignee`, `updatedSince`, `createdSince`, `page`, `pageSize`
- Relative time support: Use "7d", "24h", "30m" in date filters
- Exponential backoff retry logic for network errors and rate limits
- Structured content responses for better type safety
- Full Zod schema validation throughout

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for migration guide.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- FreeScout instance with API access enabled

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this MCP server is with `npx`:

### With Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop settings (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freescout": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://your-freescout-domain.com",
        "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With Cursor IDE

Add this to your Cursor MCP settings:

**Method 1: Via Cursor Settings UI**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "MCP"
3. Click "Edit in settings.json"
4. Add the MCP server configuration

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**
Add this to your Cursor settings.json or create `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "freescout": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest"],
        "env": {
          "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://your-freescout-domain.com",
          "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! The server will automatically use your current workspace directory for Git operations.

## Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install and run the server locally:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout.git
cd mcp-freescout
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Configure your MCP client to use the local installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freescout": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-freescout/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://your-freescout-domain.com",
        "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage with Other MCP Clients

Run the server directly:

```bash
npm start
```

Or in development mode with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Docker / HTTP transport

In addition to the stdio entrypoint, this package ships an HTTP entrypoint
(`dist/http.js`, bin: `mcp-freescout-http`) that speaks the MCP Streamable HTTP
transport. It is designed to run inside a shared Docker container while still
letting each user authenticate with their own FreeScout API key.

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t mcp-freescout-http .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e FREESCOUT_URL=https://support.example.com \
  mcp-freescout-http
```

The container only knows the FreeScout instance URL. **No API key is configured
at container start.** A `docker-compose.yml` example is included in the repo.

### Authenticate per connection

MCP clients connect to `POST /mcp` and pass the user's FreeScout API key as a
Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <user-freescout-api-key>
```

The server uses that key for every FreeScout request it makes on behalf of the
connection, against the fixed `FREESCOUT_URL`. Requests without a valid
`Authorization: Bearer …` header are rejected with HTTP 401 and a
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge.

### Environment variables (HTTP mode)

| Variable                    | Required | Default | Description                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `FREESCOUT_URL`             | yes      | —       | Base URL of the FreeScout instance.         |
| `PORT`                      | no       | `3000`  | HTTP port the server binds to.              |
| `FREESCOUT_DEFAULT_USER_ID` | no       | `1`     | Default `userId` for note/draft operations. |

`FREESCOUT_API_KEY` is **not** read by the HTTP entrypoint — it is supplied per
request via `Authorization: Bearer`.

### Health check

`GET /healthz` returns `{"status":"ok","version":"…"}` for use as a
container/orchestrator health probe. The bundled Docker image also defines a
`HEALTHCHECK` that polls this endpoint.

### Stdio mode still works

The original stdio entrypoint (`mcp-freescout`, `dist/index.js`) is unchanged
and still reads `FREESCOUT_URL` + `FREESCOUT_API_KEY` from the environment, for
local single-user installs.

Thank you for reporting the HighLevel OAuth authorization issue! Your experience with the EngageBay LiveChat plugin conflict has been really valuable.

Based on what we learned from your case, I've added a new plugin conflict detection system to WP Fusion. In the next update (v3.46.7), users will see:

🔍 **Plugin Conflict Detection**
- Automatic detection of known conflicting plugins  
- Warning messages before HighLevel authorization
- Clear guidance when conflicts are detected

This should prevent the confusion you experienced and help other users avoid similar issues.

The update should be available within the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience and for helping us improve the plugin!

Best regards,
Jack`,

  isExplanatory: true,
});
```

## Architecture

### Components

1. **FreeScout API Client** (`freescout-api.ts`)
   - Handles all API communication with FreeScout
   - Manages authentication and request formatting
   - Provides ticket parsing utilities

2. **Ticket Analyzer** (`ticket-analyzer.ts`)
   - Intelligent ticket content analysis
   - Issue classification (bug vs feature vs configuration)
   - Code snippet and error extraction
   - Root cause determination

3. **MCP Server** (`index.ts`)
   - Tool registration and request handling
   - Integration with Git for worktree management
   - Response formatting and error handling

### Data Flow

```
User Request → MCP Server → FreeScout API → Ticket Analyzer
                    ↓                             ↓
              Git Operations              Analysis Results
                    ↓                             ↓
              Worktree Management         Customer Reply
                    ↓                             ↓
                Response → User
```

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freescout": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@verygoodplugins/mcp-freescout@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FREESCOUT_URL": "https://support.example.com",
        "FREESCOUT_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "FREESCOUT_DEFAULT_USER_ID": "2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### FreeScout API Setup

1. Log into your FreeScout instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to Manage → API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions:
   - View conversations
   - Update conversations
   - Create threads (for notes)

## Best Practices

### Ticket Analysis

- Always analyze tickets before implementing fixes
- Check for third-party limitations before attempting fixes
- Verify reproducibility with team notes

### Customer Communication

- Generate draft replies for review
- Include fix descriptions in customer communications
- Use explanatory replies for non-bug issues

## Migration from v1.x to v2.0

### Breaking Changes

The `freescout_search_tickets` tool has been redesigned with explicit filter parameters. The old query-string syntax is no longer supported.

**Before (v1.x):**

```json
{
  "query": "assignee:null",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**After (v2.0):**

```json
{
  "assignee": "unassigned",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**For text search:**

```json
{
  "textSearch": "authentication error",
  "assignee": "unassigned",
  "updatedSince": "7d"
}
```

### New Features to Adopt

1. **Relative time filters**: Use `"7d"`, `"24h"`, `"30m"` instead of calculating ISO dates
2. **Pagination**: Add `page` and `pageSize` parameters for large result sets
3. **Structured outputs**: All tools now return typed `structuredContent` for better integration

### Automatic Retries

The server now automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff. No configuration needed - it just works more reliably.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Connection Errors

- Verify your FreeScout URL includes the protocol (https://)
- Check API key permissions in FreeScout
- Ensure your FreeScout instance has API access enabled
- **New in v2.0**: The server will automatically retry transient connection errors

#### Ticket Parsing Issues

- The server accepts ticket IDs, numbers, and full URLs
- URLs are automatically parsed to extract ticket IDs
- Numeric inputs are treated as ticket IDs

#### Rate Limiting (429 Errors)

- **New in v2.0**: The server automatically detects rate limits and backs off
- Retry logic includes exponential backoff with jitter
- No manual intervention needed
